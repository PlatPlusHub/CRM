# Purpose

This document tells any agent or human where the project currently stands.

It exists to answer one question: what phase, task, and Change Request is active right now.

For where to begin, what to read, and who governs conduct, see `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` — this document does not restate their responsibilities.

This file holds ONLY current state. Per-SPEC history lives in the git log, `changes/*.md` and `reports/`. Leanness keeps every bootstrap cheap, and Check 5 enforces it mechanically — the budget is never raised to fit, so trim instead.

# Current Development Status

Current state only. `Last Completed` names the single most recent capability — REPLACE it each time, never chain a "Prior:" history. If any field becomes a changelog, trim it.

Current Phase: **Phase 8 (Offline Conversion) — IN PROGRESS**. Execution order 7→9→8→10 (`32`). Phases 2–7 + 9 COMPLETE. Supabase-native backend (ADR-0014); transport ADR-0023. **Phase 10 is NOT ready** — evidence in `32` under Phase 10; blocker is Phase 8's unbuilt n8n workflow, gated behind the Foundation Completion Programme.

Current Module: Phase-8 offline-conversion / Foundation Completion Programme Batch 6. The Agent Control Plane is closed: the contract partition is mechanically enforced against the Git baseline, the manifest pointer and contract Status are one invariant checked both ways, engineering method lives in `ENGINEERING_METHOD.md` so routine execution no longer reads it, and the evidence chain is now as deterministic as the write-authority chain. The n8n workflow remains governed by `MASTER_INTEGRATION_CATALOG.md §2/§2a`; the real-GCLID test stays on hold until genuine ad-click traffic exists.

Deployment topology (owner-ratified 2026-08-20, permanent): `PlatPlusHub/CRM` deploys to **Primary `vrvtsxexkiiiivlkdxzp` only**. Secondary `brplkqmbzffpxqgkkdzo` is the `Shehabhub/ORVION` environment and is never a CRM target; differences between the two are expected and valid. Detail: `MASTER_INTEGRATION_CATALOG.md §0/§4`.

Live state: Last fully verified 2026-09-20. **repository, local stack and Primary `vrvtsxexkiiiivlkdxzp` all at 219 migrations** (latest `20260920120000`), ledger `dd2427080e9cfb5e8d1d162bf818360f`, full-function-surface hash `f791acdba3e91462b1625ab8a723db4d` (298 functions) identical on both; structural-surface hash `9643df5aca26571e856909d23ac5beb5` local vs `e17675f70c73be8953b6f057a068a9ff` Primary (3,291/3,624) — **nine of ten surfaces identical**; the tenth is platform-managed `service_role` grants (**PAR-5**). Re-read live from Primary 2026-09-20; ledger **read FROM Primary** (GUARD-1). **77 tables**; 71/621 catalog; **8 reporting views**; **79 client RPCs**. Suite **118 files / 1958 assertions** (Pass A = Pass B) plus **449 end-to-end HTTP assertions** across six scripts, last passed 2026-09-20.

Batch 6 surface coverage: **13 of 77 surfaces have a recorded audit disposition**, all thirteen at `ADVERSARIAL` (`MASTER_SURFACE_DISPOSITION.md`, Checks 22 and 24). Batch 6 is **NOT complete**; exit criteria EC-1…EC-11 and the adversarial method live in `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`. The next slice is ranked by `scripts/batch6_select_target.ps1`, which stores nothing. **Its ranking was INVERTED until 2026-09-08 and is now EXPOSURE-ordered**; `Score` is a diagnostic, not the sort key. Primary last recorded **zero business rows** (2026-09-08; not re-read this session).

Active Change Request: None

Open owner decisions — **MAIL-1**, **RET-1**. These are exact external prerequisites, not unresolved architecture: MAIL-1 has technically selected Resend but production activation still requires owner authorization and counsel/PDPC confirmation for the actual cross-border destination; RET-1's retention/closure architecture and legal-hold override are implemented, while counsel must supply the actual per-type periods as tenant configuration. No email is sent and no retention policy is seeded while those prerequisites remain. The other eight decisions in the 2026-09-09 closure are resolved and removed from this OPEN line; evidence lives in `MASTER_GAP_REGISTER.md`.

Last Completed: **SPEC-202 origination must begin as Draft, Complete (2026-09-20).** A Change Request born `Approved` was never evidence-checked, because the Pre-Approval evaluator is reached only when the contract exists at the comparison baseline. Forward-only from the existing `SPEC Allocation Enforcement` marker, a newly originated contract must first appear as `Draft`; pre-activation history keeps its own law. 270 assertions, three isolated mutation kills.

Narrative: `agent-control-plane-corrective-repair-2026-09-11.md` — the latest *session report* (Check 10 pairs this with `reports/README.md`). `SPEC-160` deliberately wrote none: its contract, tests and Git own the evidence.

Current session blocker: **None.**

Other open work is owned elsewhere and is never restated as the next action: `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` owns Batch 6 order, the Phase-10 Meta-ecosystem Learn-Before-Designing research and the communications-domain Design Challenge; `MASTER_INTEGRATION_CATALOG.md §2/§2a` owns the preserved n8n workflow build steps.

Next capability: **close Batch 6 Slice 12** — deployed and its generated consumer regenerated; a successor must certify it, then Slice 13. **The control-plane optimization chapter is CLOSED** — reopening it requires newly earned evidence (a real incident, a false green or false red, a measured material cost, or a proven safety/governance gap), never a further search for theoretical optimizations. Standing facts: Ruleset 22950574 requires `orvion-acceptance` on the default branch with `non_fast_forward`, `deletion` and zero bypass; candidates are published by `scripts/publish_candidate.ps1`, which proves the committed range first and replaces a rejected preflight candidate only under a caller-pinned lease; `main` is promoted by pushing the exact accepted SHA. Migration CI was compared on one candidate by SPEC-203: it agreed exactly.

# Governance and Ownership

This document owns only the state above. Every other responsibility belongs elsewhere, by design, and is not restated here:

- Project identity, vision, and platform boundaries — `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Engineering principles, execution rules, and workflow — `AGENTS.md` (with `GOVERNANCE.md` for knowledge governance and `CR_LIFECYCLE.md` for CR mechanics). `PROTOCOL.md` is retired to a pointer and owns nothing.
- Document discovery and reading order — `AGENTS.md §4` (the single, mandatory boot sequence); `README.md` is the one-hop router into it.
- Phase and module progress — `_ORVION_CANONICAL/32_execution_roadmap.md`, the single source of truth for that state.
- Per-capability history and rationale — the git log, `changes/*.md`, and `reports/`.
